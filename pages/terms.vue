A list of accepted gift cards to be used on the PayGarden service may be found at https://www.paygarden.com/brands.

2. AGREEMENT TO VIEW ADULT MATERIAL

2.1 Portal is designed and intended solely for adults who are interested in and wish to have access to visual images, verbal descriptions and audio sounds of a sexually oriented, and frankly erotic, nature. The material available by the Company within Portal may include graphic visual depictions and descriptions of nudity and sexual activity and is prohibited to be accessed by anyone under legal age in their respective country or by those who do not wish to be exposed to such material. By accessing Portal or purchasing a Membership from the Company you are making the following statements to Company, its licensors and other suppliers:

"Under penalty of perjury, I swear/affirm as of this moment, I am an adult, at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in my jurisdiction. I promise I will not permit any person(s) under the age of majority to have access to any of the material contained within Portal. I understand, when I gain access to Portal I will be exposed to visual images, verbal descriptions and audio sounds of a sexually oriented and frankly erotic nature, which may include graphic visual depictions and descriptions of nudity and sexual activity. I am voluntarily choosing to do so, because I want to view, read and/or hear the various materials which are available for my own personal enjoyment, information and/or education. My choice is a manifestation of my interest in sexual matters which is both healthy and normal and which in my experience, is generally shared by average adults in my community. I am familiar with the standards in my community regarding the acceptance of such sexually oriented content and the materials I expect to encounter are within those standards. In my judgment, the average adult in my community accepts the consumption of such material by willing adults in circumstances such as this and will not find such material to appeal to a prurient interest or to be patently offensive."
